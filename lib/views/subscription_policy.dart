You can subscribe to the category of your choice by clicking the Subscribe option, choosing the devices, and making the required payment for the subscription plan of your choice. In order to access the Counseling content, you will need to use a personal computer, a mobile device, portable media player, or any other device that meets the system and compatibility requirements (a "Compatible Device"). The Compatible Devices may change from time to time and, in some cases, whether a device is (or remains) a Compatible Device may depend on software or systems provided or maintained by the device manufacturer or other third parties. Accordingly, devices that are Compatible Devices at one time may cease to be Compatible Devices in the future. Thus, kindly make sure that the device that you use is compatible with our system/software to avail the Subscription Service. \n
